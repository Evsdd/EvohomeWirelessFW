// Compile for NanoCUL using board: Arduino Nano ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)

This should work with Domoticz (http://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Evohome) to control evohome or you can control it directly via the serial interface if you use the correct protocol. This sketch can also serve as template for creation of an evohome compatible wireless device. 

You will require a NanoCUL and you will also need the Arduino IDE from http://arduino.cc/en/main/software or via sudo apt-get install arduino. Once you have the IDE installed you should copy the sketch (EvohomeWirelessFW folder) to your Sketchbook folder. You then select the board as above, choose the appropriate serial device and select upload from the menu.
