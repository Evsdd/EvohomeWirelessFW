// Compile using In-Circuit Radino CC1101 board

This should work with Domoticz (http://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Evohome) to control evohome or you can control it directly via the serial interface if you use the correct protocol. This sketch can also serve as template for creation of an evohome compatible wireless device. 

This branch has been configured to work on the In-Circuit Radino CC1101 (Signalduino) Micro-based device. Once you have the IDE installed you should copy the sketch (EvohomeWirelessFW folder) to your Sketchbook folder. You then select the board as above, choose the appropriate serial device and select upload from the menu. 

NOTE: message sending will not function at the default clock speed of 115200 and the alternate values of 76800 or 250000 are recommended.
